Summary: Following along with Brad and Florin doing 50 JavaScript projects to get better at JavaScript. Today was a simple blur loading screen that starts off with an opacity at 30px and over a few seconds loads into a clear image. Simple, but used the most JavaScript so far of these courses. We had to create a function that blurs the elements as they load in, but also stop once the counter reaches 100 which we did with an if statement. We also used a function someone created on StackOverflow that intakes the variable number, in this case one that progresses upwards, then we added our bottom number 0, our top number 100, our output opacity, (30 in this case is where we decided to start, anything more and it was much too blurry) and finally where we end with 0.
